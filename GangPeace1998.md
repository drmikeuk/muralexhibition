In 1998, muralist Jameel Parker positioned Douglass the elder statesman next to the figures of W.E.B. Du Bois, Elijah Muhammad from the Nation of Islam and the radical Malcolm X. 

The mural was a dedication to a young African American Bostonian boy called Dominic Mount who was killed in the street in 1992. Parker uses African American giants from history to issue his message: 

>It’s gotta stop 

Enlisting the help of Douglass the elder statesmen, he selected an individual who left an indelible mark on the city of Boston. Douglass spoke at historical landmarks such as Faneuil Hall, the African Meeting House and the Twelfth Baptist Church, and on January 1, 1863 at Tremont Temple, Douglass and hundreds of black and white abolitionists celebrated Lincoln’s issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation.
