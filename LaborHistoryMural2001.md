This mural depicts Douglass in both the early and latter stages of his life, with the central elder statesman figure being drawn from Matthew Brady’s 1889 carte-de-visite of Douglass. 

On September 18, 1838, Frederick Douglass settled in New Bedford after escaping from slavery in Maryland, with the help of his soon-to-be wife, Anna Murray. 

It was in New Bedford where Douglass experienced, for the first time, what it was like to live as a free man. Undergoing a symbolic transformation, the recently free man changed his name from Frederick Johnson to Frederick Douglass in the September of 1838. 

 In New Bedford his abolitionist identity truly started to take shape. He read his first copy of The Liberator, became a licensed preacher, gave a speech in 1839 that denounced the proposal of free slaves be forced to emigrate back to Africa, and was hired as an agent by the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society (MASS). 

In 1841, after attending a regional convention for the followers of William Lloyd Garrison, Douglass felt compelled to speak about his time in bondage. Inspiring the Garrisonian audience, he was shortly recruited by the Garrisonian’s as a travelling lecturer for MASS.
