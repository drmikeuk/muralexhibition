In 1860, Frederick Douglass took to the stage at the African Meeting House to give his speech, “A Plea for Free Speech in Boston.”

Directly borrowing from the speech, muralists Deborah Browder and Heidi Schork transcribe Douglass’s words onto their mural at Hammond and Tremont Street. 

>“Liberty is meaningless when the right to utter one’s thoughts and opinions has ceased to exist.''

 Three years later, in the same Meeting House on Joy Street, Beacon Hill, African American soldiers, including two of Douglass’s sons, were recruited into the Fifty-fourth Regiment of the Massachusetts Infantry under the leadership of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. 

 The 2003 likeness of Douglass depicts him in the middle stage of his visual transformation, which spanned from the early 1860s to the late 1870s. This was Douglass as the fiery radical abolitionist, and Browder and Schork base their mural on John White Hurn’s carte-de-visite from 1863.
