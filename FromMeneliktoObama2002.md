In 1878, Frederick Douglass moved to Anacostia, Washington D.C. where he was given the moniker “The Lion of Anacostia.” 

Working for the federal government in D.C. Douglass was the U.S. Marshal for the District of Columbia in 1877, the Recorder of the deeds for Washington D.C. in 1881, and Minister Resident Consul General to Haiti in 1889. 

His house, now a national historic site, sits upon a hill in a symbolic location that overlooks both Maryland and Washington D.C. -- the place he was born into slavery and a place where he undertook work for the government as a freeman and one of the most important African Americans in history.

Mekbib Gebertsadik surrounds Douglass in the mural with giants of abolitionist history, Black Nationalist history and contemporary history. President Lincoln, Harriet Tubman, John Brown, Sojourner Truth, Malcolm X and President Obama and Michelle Obama all gather around Douglass. 

Titling the mural “From Menelik I to Obama” Gebertsadik places Douglass on a timeline of diasporic history that starts with Menelik I, the first Solomonic Emperor of Ethiopia from 950 BC, to President Barack Obama, the US’s first African American president.
