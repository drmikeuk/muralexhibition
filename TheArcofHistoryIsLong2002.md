The anonymous muralist has borrowed and altered Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous quotation:

 >the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards freedom

The inclusive mural features figures such as Susan B. Anthony, Rosie the Riveter, William Lloyd Garrison and W.E.B. Du Bois, as well as a young, clean shaven Douglass as the recently emancipated individual in the first stage of his visual transition. 

This period of Douglass’s life mainly spans from the 1840s and 1850s, and his photographic representations are predominantly one-of-a-kind daguerreotypes and ambrotypes. Unable to be reproduced, these images could only be engraved for mass reproduction and dissemination. It was during this youthful stage in Douglass’s life that he gave a speech in Boston on February 8, 1855 entitled “An Inside View of Slavery,” whereby he drew attention to, what he believed, was the greatest cruelty of slavery: the psychological impact of being in bondage. 

>Whipping is not what constitutes the cruelty of Slavery, to me the thought that I am a slave is more terrible than any lash, than any chain.
