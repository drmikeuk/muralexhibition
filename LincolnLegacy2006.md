Although Sarantitis titles his mural “Lincoln Legacy,” the 10,000 square feet mural is textured with African American history as the mural can be read from left to right, moving from Africa to America. 

The shape of Africa adorns the backdrop until the wooden boards of the slave ship transform into the American flag. Around the young child’s neck sits three medallions: a coin with Lincoln’s face, a coin with Josiah Wedgwood’s abolitionist iconographic image “Am I Not a Man and a Brother” and Matthew Brady’s 1889 carte-de-visite image of Douglass. 

Actually made up of mosaic tiles, the “Lincoln Legacy” is the largest Venetian glass tile mural in the world. 

On August 6, 1847, after a meeting with the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, a group of African Americans held a reception for Frederick Douglass at Bethel A.M.E. Church. It was at this meeting where Douglass took the opportunity to accuse the nation’s churches for their pro-slavery attitude. 

Bringing tears and laughter from the crowd, an on-looking reporter believed Douglass’s speech finally answered the expectations of the people of Pennsylvania.
